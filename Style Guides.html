        <h1>Living Style Guide</h1>
     <p>A living style guide is a reference for a team of designers and developers to understand how an application will look and feel. It is used to convey design language, define design rationale, and explain how to use markup. A living style guide creates shared understanding among all team members and is a place for the whole team to reference how something should look and feel.
Living style guides should change and adapt to new needs and challenges that arise during the life of a project. Nothing should be written in stone, and they should consistently be refined and revised.</p>
                
<h1>Usefull for developers and designers</h1>
              <li><b>Time Saving</b></li>
                <p> Style guide saves time by providing quick answers to questions that may arise while writing documentation.</p>

            <li><b>Cost Savings</b></li>
                <p>Employees with access to their company's style guide spend fewer hours writing, reviewing, and correcting documentation. A style guide reduces the expense of repetitive training and prevents costly mistakes that result when an operator, for instance, is forced to read inconsistent or poorly written operating instructions.</p>

                <li><b>Consistency</b></li>
                <p>A style guide promotes consistency among documents throughout the company. This leads to fewer arguments over questions of style and format and to less duplicated effort, resulting in savings of both time and money.</p>

            <li><b>Professional</b></li>
                <p>In helping to write and maintain a style guide, employees have an opportunity to share their expertise and knowledge internally. Externally, your company enhances its image by developing and using an effective time- and money-management tool and by consistently producing quality documentation.</p>
